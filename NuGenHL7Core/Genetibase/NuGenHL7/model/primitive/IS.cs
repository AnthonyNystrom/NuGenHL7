	/// The value of such a field follows the formatting rules for a ST field except that it is
	/// drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. There shall be an HL7
	/// table number associated with IS data types. An example of an IS field is the Event reason
	/// code defined in Section 3.3.1.4, "Event reason code." This data type should be used only for
	/// user-defined tables (see Section 2.7.6, "Table"). The reverse is not true, since in some
	/// circumstances, it is more appropriate to use the CE data type for user-defined tables.
