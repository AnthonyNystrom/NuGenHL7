	/// <summary> <p>A Pointer is a placeholder used in parsing traditionally encoded messages 
	/// (which do not explicitly identify segment groups).  Implementations of Pointer 
	/// include SegmentPointer, which "points" to a Segment slot.  This pointer can 
	/// exist whether or not the underlying Segment object has been created.  There is 
	/// only one pointer per slot - multiple repetitions are accessed through the 
	/// same pointer.  <code>prepNewInstance</code> is used to create a new rep.  
	/// <code>setSegment(String segment)</code> is responsible for parsing the given 
	/// segment string <i>into</i> the current rep of the underlying Segment.  Similarly 
	/// there is a subclass called GroupPointer that points to a Group slot.  
	/// GroupPointer's <code>setSegment(...)</code> method just forwards the request to 
	/// it's children (which are GroupPointers and SegmentPointers). </p>
