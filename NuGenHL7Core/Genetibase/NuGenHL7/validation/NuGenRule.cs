	/// <summary> <p>A testable rule to which HL7 messages (at least certain specific message) should conform.  
	/// This is the central interface of the new HAPI validation model (as of HAPI 0.4).  
	/// Previously, the only run-time message validation HAPI performs is within the
	/// setValue() methods of the Primitive datatype classes.  For example when you
	/// called setValue() on a DT an exception was thrown if the String arg was not in
	/// the correct DT format.  This method served well initially but left us with the 
	/// following limitations: 
	/// <ol><li>Sometimes validation is inappropriate (e.g. some of the standard rules, like phone
	/// number format, don't make sense in some regions).  </li>
	/// <li>Couldn't add further optional constraints (such as all timestamps must have
	/// a time zone).  </li>
	/// <li>Couldn't turn off validation to improve performance. </li>
	/// <li>Other forms of validation (e.g. conformance profiles, standard DTDs) were
	/// not covered.  </li></ol></p>
	/// <p>Thus the new validation model is broader in scope, and is based on validation rules 
	/// implemented as Rule objects, which can be configured to run or not, as needed, depending on 
	/// run-time configuration.</p>
	/// <p>There are three kinds of rules: 
	/// <ol><li>DataTypeRule: Called when the values of simple datatypes are set, like
	/// the existing hard-coded datatype validations (e.g. TNFollowsNorthAmericanFormat).</li>  
	/// <li>MessageRule: Called when complete message content is to be checked on a
	/// parsed message (e.g. conformance profile). </li>
	/// <li>EncodingRule: Applied to an encoded message (e.g. validation against a
	/// 2.xml Schema, a rule that prohibits empty tags, etc.).</li>
	/// </ol></p>
